        We want to operate in an ecosystem that empowers developers to reach their potential.<br>
        One that encourage growth and collaboration. A space that is safe for everyone who wants to inhabit it.

    <p class="cover-text">
        A place like this would benefit everyone that participates in it. It would encourage new
        developers to enter our field and allow current developers to have a voice. It would empower conversation
        and discussion. It is through discussion and collaboration that we grow, and through growth that we improve.

        The foundation of a place like that is built on respect.
        In the effort to create such a place, we hold to these values
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Discrimination limits us.</strong>
            This includes discrimination on the basis of race, gender, gender identity & expression,
            sexual orientation, nationality and any other arbitrary exclusion of a group of people.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Boundaries honor us.</strong>
            Your comfort levels are not everyoneâ€™s comfort levels. Remember that, and if brought
            to your attention, heed it.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>We are our biggest assets.</strong>
            None of us were born masters of our trade. Each of us has been helped along the way.
            Return that favor, when and where you can.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>We are resources for the future.</strong>
            As an extension of #3, share what you know. Make yourself a resource to help those that
            come after you.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Respect defines us.</strong>
            Treat others as you wish to be treated. Make your discussions, criticisms and debates from
            a position of respectfulness. Ask yourself, is it true, is it necessary, is it constructive?
            Anything less is untolerated.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            <strong>Reactions require grace.</strong>
            Angry responses are valid, but abusive language and vindictive
            actions are toxic. When something happens that offends you, handle it assertively, but be respectful.
            Escalate reasonably, and try to allow the offender an opportunity to explain themselves, and possibly
            correct the issue.
        </li>
        </ol>
