            <p >We want to operate in an ecosystem that empowers developers to reach their potential. One that encourage growth and collaboration. A space that is safe for all.</p>
            <p >
             A space such as this benefits everyone that participates in it. It encourages new developers to enter our field. It is through discussion and collaboration that we grow, and through growth that we improve.

			<h4>
            In the effort to create such a place, we hold to these values
            </h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<strong>Discrimination limits us.</strong> This includes discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, nationality and any other arbitrary exclusion of a group of people.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Boundaries honor us.</strong> Your comfort levels are not everyoneâ€™s comfort levels. Remember that, and if brought to your attention, heed it.
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>We are our biggest assets.</strong> None of us were born masters of our trade. Each of us has been helped along the way. Return that favor, when and where you can. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>We are resources for the future.</strong> As an extension of #3, share what you know. Make yourself a resource to help those that come after you. 
				</li>
				<li>
				<strong>Respect defines us.</strong> Treat others as you wish to be treated. Make your discussions, criticisms and debates from a position of respectfulness. Ask yourself, is it true, is it necessary, is it constructive? Anything less is untolerated. 
				</li>
				<li>
				 <strong>Reactions require grace.</strong> Immediate rage is neither constructive nor respectful. When something happens that offends you, handle it respectfully, and quietly. Escalate reasonably, if necessary, but only after allowing the offender opportunity to explain themselves, and possibly correct the issue.
				</li>
